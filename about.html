                    This program is used for many things such as putting effects to videos allowing a smoother and easier expirence than most tradional video editors. One of the main things I use it for is to animate
                    many of the graphics I make to make them into motion graphics were I take a still image I designed and turn it into a animated image.

                   At CTC I was bouncing between taking either Computer Coding and Programming or Digital Media. In the end I decided to take Coding and Programming. In this class I have learned 
                   the basics of web design and have learned alot about CSS and HTML which is a big impovment from the very basics of JavaScript I learned in Intro to Computer Science. I also will get 
                   the honor to compete in Skills USA state afte winning first in my class for the compition. I have absoulutly loved my expirence here and I can't wait to continue learning more.

                 I have had to slef teach myself everything I know about after effects. Alot of this came from mastering the layout in and out then looking up
                 tutorials or google for whatever I want done. I also had to teach myslef alot more about Photoshop since the class I took was only a one semester class. I was also
                 fortunate enough to be able to afford my own gaming PC which I also learned how to build myself.
